# PDX Ruby Challenges

This repository contains the Ruby coding challenges for the PDX Ruby Beginners meetup. Each week, members of the meetup group discuss the challenge assigned at the previous meetup and present their solutions.

#### To participate:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Locate the challenge you wish to complete. The directory for each challenge is prefixed with the date of the meetup at which the challenge will be presented.
3. Read the README file in that directory for instructions regarding the challenge.
4. Run the *_spec.rb file for that challenge. Your goal is to make all the specs pass.
5. Attend the [PDX Ruby Beginners meetup](http://calagator.org/events/search?tag=pdxruby) and discuss your solution!
